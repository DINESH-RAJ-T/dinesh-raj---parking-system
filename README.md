Hlo everyone!
    Myself Dinesh raj.T from Sathyabama Institute of science and technology.
  Here i'm uploading my PT-1 project details(HCL MINI-PROJECT).
  Title of my project is "Parking Space Management system".
    This is the project which keeps records of the vehicle which is going to park in the parking area and exit from the parking area.
    Tools and Technologies Used in the project is
         
HTML, CSS, BOOTSTRAP, JAVASCRIPT and HTML2CANVAS were used to make this.
    My project represents about the "Parking Space Management System"
        what it describes is:-
            A simple parking system that stores all the necessary info about parked cars in a parking table and when a car is ready
to check out it transfers all its info to a receipt table and calculates the total amount it's due based on its time of arrival 
in the receipt table, there is a view button that opens a modal with all the necessary info about the cars stay in the parking lot, and provides
a download option which clicked downloads a .png format of the modal this is done using html2canvas.


The main features and motive of my project is to provide fair price for parking & avoid violence between customer and security.
Because customer pays the bill for 2hr but they park the vehicle for 1.30hr so they are paying extra fees for not using the parking.
My parking management system will help the customer to save their money, and friendly bond between security(management) and customer.

Thank you...
